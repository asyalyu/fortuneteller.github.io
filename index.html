Hello World
My plan is to make a fortune teller ai. Our generation profoundly struggles with decision making (hence this webpage doesn't have a theme lol). 
I would like to alleviate these difficulties that are faced by many people that I know, by creating a chatbot specialized in telling you what to 
do with your life (its like an aunty you never knew you needed). 
Such an application/chatbot can be implemented with existing ai tools such as Chatgpt API and prompt engineering. However I’d want to
create a more specialized chatbot thats trained on questions about what to do with one’s life and answers that make sense/ are helpful. 
Thus unlike existing tools, this would be a specialized digital fortune teller. 
This project could have serious ethical concerns, as influencing someone’s life choices comes with a lot of responsibility. The training
would then have to be very clear and not include any drastic /lethal suggestions. Furthermore such a tool should definitely have a disclaimer 
regarding its use and a warning that the output of this chatbot is advice generated by a dataset and not actually what you should 100% follow. 
Success for this project would be implementing a prototype of such a tool and potentially having a couple people use it as a user study.
This project quite ironically combines the ancient and mystical art of fortune telling with modern data driven technology, making it both a 
fun and funny endeavor.
